        <h2>About Me</h2>

        <ul class="Aboutmelist">
            <li>I am currently a sophomore at the University of Arizona completing a Bachelor of Science in Software
                Engineering.
            </li>
            <li>I was born in the city of Tucson, AZ, but was raised in a small border town in Mexico where I lived
                until the age of 14.
            </li>
            <li>In the past year, I have gained intermediate proficiency in C/C++ and learned the basics of Python and
                Verilog.
            </li>
            <li>In the next year, I am expecting to complete courses that will allow me to become fully proficient in
                Python and C/C++, as well as gain some basic knowledge in Javascript.
            </li>
            <li>During my first three semesters at the University of Arizona, I worked in the department of Campus
                Recreation, where I started as a Facility Services Attendant and got promoted to Facility Manager after
                being named the 2021 Attendant of the Year.
            </li>
            <li>I am currently looking for opportunities as an intern to gain more knowledge in the field and experience
                different work environments.
            </li>
        </ul>
